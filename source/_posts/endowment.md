## Overview

<p>Three students and I designed, implemented, and analyzed a field experiment as part of our studies. </p>

### Abstract

<p>The endowment effect is the tendency for people who own a good to value it more than people who do not.
Its economic impact is consequential. It creates market inefficiencies and irregularities in valuation such as
differences between buyers and sellers, reluctance to trade, and mere ownership effects. This study (n=495)
presents evidence that endowment effect can be elicited merely by assigned ownership. Employing survey
responses we were able to generate an endowment effect size of 15-20 times increase between
willingess to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA).</p>
