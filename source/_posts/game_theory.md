Ever since reading Freakonomics, I have been an ameteur enthusiast of game theory. One of my favorite interactive demonstrations of game theory comes from Nick Case who created [“The Evolution of Trust.”](https://ncase.me/trust/ "The Evolution of Trust") This game goes through variations of the prisoner’s dilemma where you play against different characters with unique game-play styles. </p>

After playing this game for the first time I became interested in seeing the results of other game-play styles of my own creation. To replicate the game in functionality, I created an object oriented Python script and my own fictional players. 

To do this I started by creating a design doc and applying top down thinking to identify the classes I would need. The classes grouped into three buckets: (1) Defining fictional players, (2) running the simulation, and (3) receiving inputs to return the current score every round. I made a few edits as I built out new characters and functionality, but overall I stuck to the design doc. The final product replicated the functionality of the game and created some of my own characters that were additive to Nick’s original work.

To play the game, [download game_theory.py](https://github.com/pbarranger/example_projects/tree/master/game_theory_object_oriented/ "Game Theory Simulation Code") from my GitHub account. Run the program on your local machine and respond to the program generated questions. Good luck!
